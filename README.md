Kaggle House Price Prediction Challenge
This project is aimed at leveraging advanced regression techniques to predict the sale price of houses in the Kaggle House Prices Competition dataset, based on a myriad of features provided in the Kaggle dataset.

Project Overview
The objective of this challenge is to create a model that can accurately predict the final price of each home, based on 70+ explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook, Kaggle_House_Prices.ipynb, which outlines exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation process. The repository also contains a requirements.txt file containing all packages needed to run the Jupyter notebook.
